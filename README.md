# Final Project: Individual-Self-Assessment

## Self-Assessment

Presents a cohesive written analysis that describes the role(s) they played over the course of the project and their contribution to the project in that role. 

Presents a cohesive written summary of how they contributed to each of the roles they did not take on via team discussions, peer reviews, or other means. 

Additionally, the analysis should describe their greatest personal challenge over the course of the project, and how they overcame that challenge. 


## Team Assessment

**Our communication protocol - what worked, what didn't, and how did we achieve success with our project as a team**

âœ“ Our communication protocol, including any challenges, how they were resolved, and what we would do differently next time 

**Our strengths as a team**
- Everyone worked well together.

**Tips and Tricks for a new cohort kicking off their own project**
- Try to choose a topic that is interesting. It'll make the process more enjoyable for you and your group, and the audience will be interested in what you have to say.
- Poll your team to find out everyone's particular strengths.
- Choose data that has not already been adjusted to meet the needs of a different project. It will make it easier for your team to work the data for your particular needs.
- Work together as much as possible. This will increase the liklihood that everyone is on the same page - and informed about the project as a whole.



## Summary of Project 

My final group project for Data Analytics Boot Camp was **Rural Surge: A Study of Internet Quality and Availability in Kansas**.
We sought to answer the questions: Does geographic location impact internet quality? Does Rural-Urban classifier impact Internet Service Provider (ISP) availabilty?
We used a Random Forest machine learning model, as well as R to determine our results.
Per our findings, if there are ISPs present, rural and urban average download speeds are very similar in the state of Kansas. 
However, approximately 60% of rural areas, and 40% of urban areas in Kansas have no ISPs.
