# Final Project: Individual-Self-Assessment

## Self-Assessment

For our group project, I maintained the README file. I compiled all resources used for the project, gathered process data as the team worked through the project, and  created an outline to tell the story of our project flow. When we initially decided to do the Decision Tree model, I created a flow chart to show what questions we would be asking, and what data we would use to answer our questions. I created an ERD for some of the data we used on the project (which was later merged with other ERDs to form 1 master ERD for the project). I also worked on the Google Slides for our presentation.

For the roles/ tasks that I did not tackle for our project, I supported the person doing it by being on a Zoom call while they were working as much as possible. Fernando and Teresa are both Analysts for a living, so they have so much knowledge already handling data. I wanted to learn as much as I could from them while they were working on our project. I took notes, both for my own learning as well as for our process documentation for the README.

Additionally, the analysis should describe my greatest personal challenge over the course of the project, and how I overcame that challenge. 


## Team Assessment

**Our communication protocol - what worked, what didn't, and what would we do differently next time**
- Our team met several times on Zoom meetings over the course of the weeks leading up to the presentation. Sometimes as a whole team, sometimes it was just whoever was available, and sometimes it was whoever was working together on specific parts of the project. The first few weeks we met on Saturdays during office hours. As we drew closer to the presentation date, we met several times over the course of the week.
- We used Slack to pass info to one another while on meetings together, and also to leave each other notes about progress made when we weren't all working together.
- I think the way we communicated was very effective. I can't think of anything I would've done differently.

**Our strengths as a team**
- Everyone worked hard to complete their assigned tasks each week.
- Everyone worked well together to complete some tasks as a group.

**Tips and Tricks for a new cohort kicking off their own project**
- Try to choose a topic that is interesting. It'll make the process more enjoyable for you and your group, and the audience will be interested in what you have to say.
- Poll your team to find out everyone's particular strengths. Divide and conquer so you can all contribute, but keep everyone in the loop with what you're doing.
- Meet as a group often. This will keep everyone on the same page, with the current tasks being completed and about the project as a whole.
- Pay attention and take notes on the modules that teach you how to create and work with GitHub branches. It will make your life so much easier for this project if you know how that process works.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help. Your teammates, the TAs, and the teacher are all great resources!



## Summary of Project 

My final group project for Data Analytics Boot Camp was **Rural Surge: A Study of Internet Quality and Availability in Kansas**.
We sought to answer the questions: Does geographic location impact internet quality? Does Rural-Urban classifier impact Internet Service Provider (ISP) availabilty?
We used a Random Forest machine learning model, as well as R to determine our results.
Per our findings, if there are ISPs present, rural and urban average download speeds are very similar in the state of Kansas. 
However, approximately 60% of rural areas, and 40% of urban areas in Kansas have no ISPs.
